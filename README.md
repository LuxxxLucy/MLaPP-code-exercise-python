This repo will be updated along with my study of CMPT727 Statistical Machine Learning at Simon Fraser University  (2020 Spring). The code part is in python. It contains the code and solution to the exercise of the textbook: [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy, the 1st edition.

1. [Chap 1](https://github.com/LuxxxLucy/MLaPP-code-exercise-python/blob/master/Chapter%201/exercise_1.ipynb):

   Three code exercice about K-nearest neighbours.  Only checking the core concepts delivered in the text. Exercise 1.2 also involves the use of FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) to approximately speed up KNN. I also write a simpler python scikit-like warper for FLANN in this [repo](https://github.com/LuxxxLucy/FLANN-py-warper).
