This repo will be updated along with my study of CMPT727 Statistical Machine Learning at Simon Fraser University  (2020 Spring). The code part is in python.

This repo should contain the code and solution to the exercise of the textbook: [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy, the 1st edition.
